        <h2>As I said, I have a huge experience in photography. I have used various cameras and cameras: both SLR and digital. One of my favorite cameras I used was Canon's digital camera, which had a built-in lens capable of 50x zoom. I took a lot of cool pictures with that camera.</h2>
        <h2>But the build that I have now is without a doubt the coolest and my favorite. I use a Sony Alpha 6000 camera. This camera is of the so-called mirrorless type - something between a reflex and a digital one. It is very compact, but at the same time incredibly powerful and supports lenses from SLR cameras. You can see it in the photo above.</h2>
        <h2>In a few years, I bought all the necessary lenses. It's an ultra-wide-angle zoom lens - Sony E PZ 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS, an incredibly large aperture medium lens (my coolest and most expensive) E 50mm F1.8 OSS and a super zoom lens - a telephoto lens (a real giant) Sony E 55-210 mm f/4.5-6.3 OSS.</h2>
        <h2>Despite the fact that these lenses have OSS - stabilization, it only works for photos. The video was very difficult to film. Therefore, the icing on the cake in my assembly for photos and videos is a large steadicam (stabilizer), which you could see in my hands in the photo of me on the main page - Zhiyun Crane-M2. As you can guess, this build is quite expensive (over $1,000), but I don't even regret buying it for a minute.</h2>

        <h2>My macro assembly</h2>
        <p>Taking macro photos is no less interesting than taking ordinary ones. You can see things that you would never see with your own eyes. Macro photography requires a special lens, which I can't afford yet. Instead, I use so-called macro rings, which change the focal length of the lens to a very small one, allowing you to take photographs of objects almost right up to the lens. If only there was light on your object :) You can see these rings in the photo on the right. They are attached between the camera and the lens. You can also see examples of my macro photographs on the "Photoes" page.</p>
